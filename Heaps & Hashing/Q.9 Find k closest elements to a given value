Solution:

def findClosestElements(arr, k, x):
    max_heap = []
    
    for num in arr:
        if num == x:
            continue
        diff = abs(num - x)
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff, num))

        if len(max_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(max_heap)

    result = []

    while max_heap:
        diff, num = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        result.append(num)
        
    return sorted(result)
