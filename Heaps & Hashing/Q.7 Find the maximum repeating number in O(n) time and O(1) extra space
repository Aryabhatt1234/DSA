Problem Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-repeating-number-in-ok-time/

Solution:

def maxRepeating(arr, n,  k):
    for i in range(0,  n):
        arr[arr[i]%k] += k
 
    max = arr[0]
    result = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
     
        if arr[i] > max:
            max = arr[i]
            result = i
            
    return result
