Solution:

from heapq import heappush, heappop, heapify
import math

def streamMed(arr, N):
    g = []
    s = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        heappush(s, -arr[i])
        heappush(g, -heappop(s))
        if len(g) > len(s):
            heappush(s, -heappop(g))
 
        if len(g) != len(s):
            print(-s[0])
        else:
            print((g[0] - s[0])/2)
