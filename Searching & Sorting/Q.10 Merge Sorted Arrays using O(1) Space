Solution:

def merge(n, m):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = n - 1
    while (i <= k and j < m):
        if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]):
            i += 1
        else:
            temp = arr2[j]
            arr2[j] = arr1[k]
            arr1[k] = temp
            j += 1
            k -= 1
 
    arr1.sort()
    arr2.sort()
