Solution:

def ceilSearch(arr, low, high, x):
    if (x == 0):
        return -1
    while (low <= high):
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2
        mid = int(mid)
        if (arr[mid] == x):
            return mid
        elif (x < arr[mid]):
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
 
    return low
