Problem Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-pair-with-the-given-difference/

Solution:

def findPair( arr, size, n):
    arr.sort()
    l = 0
    r = 1
    n = abs(n)

    while (l <= r and r < size) :
        diff = arr[r] - arr[l]
        if (diff == n and l != r):
            return True
 
        elif (diff > n):
            l += 1
            r+=1
    return False
