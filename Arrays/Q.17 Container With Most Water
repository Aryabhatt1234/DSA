Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        left = 0
        right = n-1
        mx = 0

        while(left<right):
            area = min(height[left],height[right])*(right-left)
            mx = max(mx,area)

            if height[left]<height[right]:
                left+=1
            else:
                right-=1

        return mx
