Solution:

def MaxActivities(arr, n):
	selected = []
	Activity.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
	i = 0
	selected.append(arr[i])

	for j in range(1, n):
		if arr[j][0] >= arr[i][1]:
			selected.append(arr[j])
			i = j
	return selected

if __name__ == '__main__':
	Activity = [[5, 9], [1, 2], [3, 4], [0, 6], [5, 7], [8, 9]]
	n = len(Activity)

	selected = MaxActivities(Activity, n)
	print("Following activities are selected :")
	print(selected[0], end = "");
	for i in range (1, len(selected)):
		print(",", end = " ")
		print(selected[i], end = "")


Output:

Following activities are selected :
[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 7], [8, 9]
