Solution:

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n==0:
            return 0
        
        d = {}
        l = 0
        mx = 0

        for r in range(n):
            if s[r] in d and d[s[r]]>=l:
                l = d[s[r]]+1
            d[s[r]] = r
            mx = max(mx,r-l+1)

        return mx
