Solution:

      if head is None:
          return
      if head.next is None:
          return
      slow_p = head
      fast_p = head
          
      while(slow_p and fast_p and fast_p.next):
          slow_p = slow_p.next
          fast_p = fast_p.next.next
          
          if slow_p == fast_p:
            slow_p = self.head
            
            while (slow_p.next != fast_p.next):
              slow_p = slow_p.next
              fast_p = fast_p.next
