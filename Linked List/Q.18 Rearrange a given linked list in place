Solution:

def reverselist(node):
    prev = None
    curr = node
    next=None
    while (curr != None):
        next = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next
    node = prev
    return node
 
def rearrange(node):
    slow = node
    fast = slow.next
    while (fast != None and fast.next != None):
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
    node1 = node
    node2 = slow.next
    slow.next = None
    
    node2 = reverselist(node2)
    node = Node(0)
    curr = node
     
    while (node1 != None or node2 != None):
        if (node1 != None):
            curr.next = node1
            curr = curr.next
            node1 = node1.next
            
        if(node2 != None):
            curr.next = node2
            curr = curr.next
            node2 = node2.next
    node = node.next
