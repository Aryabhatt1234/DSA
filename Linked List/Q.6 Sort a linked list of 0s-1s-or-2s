Problem Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-linked-list-of-0s-1s-or-2s/

Solution:

def sortList(head):
    count = [0, 0, 0]

    current = head
    while current is not None:
        count[current.data] += 1
        current = current.next

    current = head
    i = 0
    while current is not None:
        if count[i] == 0:
            i += 1
        else:
            current.data = i
            count[i] -= 1
            current = current.next
